# vim-searchant
Vim plugin for improved search highlighting

## Overview
When it comes to searching vim is one of the editors which lacks the feature
of highlighting the current search result. Searchant wraps the hacky way to
achieve this in vim into a plugin with a clean interace. Additionally it
provides a key mapping to stop the search highlighting.
